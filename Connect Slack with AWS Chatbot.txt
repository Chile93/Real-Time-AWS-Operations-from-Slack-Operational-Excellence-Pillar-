Connect Slack with AWS Chatbot

Step 1: Create or Use a Slack Workspace
Slack is where all alerts and commands will appear, so we start by preparing the workspace.
If you don’t have a Slack workspace:

Go to https://slack.com/get-started
Sign in with your email or create a Slack account
Follow the steps to:
Create a new workspace
Set your workspace name (e.g., ChatOps Team)


Step 2: Enable AWS Chatbot for Slack
This step connects your AWS account to Slack, allowing communication between them.
Open the AWS Chatbot Console:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/home?region=us-east-1
Choose Slack as the chat client

Click “Configure new client”
You’ll be redirected to Slack:
Select your workspace
Grant permission to connect AWS Chatbot to your workspace
After approval, you'll be redirected back to the AWS Console
This gives AWS the ability to post messages in your Slack channels


Step 3: Create an SNS Topic for Slack Alerts
SNS acts as a message broker. We’ll use it to send alerts from AWS services (like CloudWatch) to Slack.
Go to the SNS Console:
Click Topics in the left menu
Click “Create topic”
Choose Standard as the topic type
Enter a name for the topic (e.g., slack-alerts-topic)
Leave other settings as default and click “Create topic”
(Optional) Add an Email Subscription
This helps you test that your SNS topic works before connecting it to Slack:

Click Create subscription
Set protocol to Email
Enter your email address

Click Create Subscription and ****Confirm subscription from your email


Step 4: Configure the Slack Channel in AWS Chatbot
Now we tell AWS which Slack channel to use, and what alerts or commands it’s allowed to handle.
Back in the AWS Chatbot console, click “Configure new channel”
Fill in the form:
Configuration name**: chatops**
Channel type: Keep it as Public.
Channel: From the dropdown, select your existing channel → #new-channel.
(If it doesn't show up, make sure the AWS Chatbot app is invited to the channel in Slack)

IAM Role Configuration:
Select “Create an IAM role using a template” from the dropdown
Set the Role name to awschatbot-role
Under Policy templates, check the following two options:
Notification permissions: Allows Chatbot to retrieve CloudWatch metrics and graphs
Amazon Q Developer access permissions: Enables interactions from Slack without full administrator access

In the Guardrail policies section:
Allow AWSLambda_FullAccess and ReadOnlyAccess
In the Notifications section:
Choose the Region where SNS topic exist (e.g., us-east-1)
Select an existing SNS topic (e.g., slack-alerts-topic)
If you haven’t created one yet, go to Amazon SNS Console and create a topic (do not forget to add a subscription)
(Optional) Enable logging to CloudWatch if you want to audit usage
Click Create and Save the configuration
This completes the secure connection between AWS alerts and Slack


Step 5: Test the Chatbot Integration
Before we continue, let’s confirm that the connection works.
In the Chatbot console, go to Configured Clients > Configured Channels
Select your channel (e.g., chatops)

Click Send test message
Open Slack and check if a test message appears in #new-channel
