Conclusion and Resource Cleanup


What You’ve Built
Connected Slack with AWS Chatbot for real-time alerts and commands
Set up IAM roles to securely allow AWS CLI access from Slack
Created CloudWatch alarms and routed them to Slack via EventBridge
Built Lambda functions that can restart services or fetch logs on command
Deployed a read-only frontend dashboard to show alerts and activity
Used CloudFormation to automate and organize the entire setup
Practiced principles from the Operational Excellence pillar
This isn’t just a project, it’s a solid foundation for ChatOps in real environments.



Clean-up Steps
To avoid ongoing AWS charges, remember to delete what you created:

1. Chatbot Setup

2. IAM Role

Head to IAM > Roles, find the chatbot role, and delete it
3. CloudWatch

Delete your alarms
4. EC2 Compute ****

Terminate your EC2 instance that was used to stress test
5. Lambda Functions

Delete the functions you created
Also clean up log groups in CloudWatch Logs
6. Frontend Dashboard

Empty and delete the S3 bucket
Disable and delete the CloudFront distribution

If you used a stack to deploy resources, go to CloudFormation and delete it
